# Financial Program
 
Hello fellow nerds who are also doing random financial shit with python. This is a project mostly for myself. I haven't been creating it with the intention that other's would really be using it. Anyways setup will be kinda a bitch if I'm not there to help you directly, but the jist of it all is that you need to get the file system running. Once you've got that running it should be smooth sailing.
