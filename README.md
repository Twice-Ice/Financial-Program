# Financial Program
 
Hello fellow nerds who are also doing random financial shit with python. This is a project mostly for myself. I haven't been creating this with the intention that others would use it so continue with caution. To start you'll wanna make sure you have python 3.12.3 before running. Then you run launchFileInit.py to get all your files set up on your computer. It might be in a really odd file location so try to make sure it's all in a good location and not hidden in like your python temp files lol. You can type the command "file" to see where the files are stored. Outside of that you'll wanna know about accounts (where money is stored), and containers (how money is distributed between accounts). Check the Help menu for commands. 

TLDR: run launchFileInit.py to start. Then you can run main.py like normally, accounts (money stored here), containers (how money is distributed), create, display, withdraw, and deposit are the key functions I use.
