1. 
    In this set up, the HRT acct never properly displays how much it has and depositing into total doesn't properly work.

    self.autoCreate("account", "HRT")
    self.autoCreate("account", "personal")
    self.autoCreate("Container", "Total", [["HRT", .5], ["Misc", .5]])
    self.autoCreate("Container", "Misc", [["HRT", .5], ["personal", .5]])

2.
    You can create a container ("c1" for exmaple),
    create another container ("c2"),
    edit c1 to deposit into c2
    and then create an infinite recusion loop when doing any sort of action.
    There's nothing in place to avoid this.

3.
    When editing containers, if you set the new value of an item to be 0.00% then the item does not get removed from the container's list of items
